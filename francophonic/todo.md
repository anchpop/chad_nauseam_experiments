1. Separate occurrences from word dictionary (separate concerns belong in separate files)

2. Process word-dictionary into a format more useful to the react app before copying (some research will be needed to figure this out)

3. Add spaced-repetition flashcards for individual french words. I want to make the user type the correct answer, to really force them to recall it.

4. Sort flashcards by usage frequency. Start by prioritizing the words in that simple french short stories book, then move on to le petit nicolas, then le petit prince, then alcatraz, then harry potter, or something like that. 

5. Display what % of the way through you are to getting to 98% of whatever book you're on. 

6. Add deepl translation source for sentences.

7. Show sentence prompts. These should probably be for learning grammar, not for learning words. So try to only show sentences where the user already knows all the words well. 

8. Show nags to remind users to keep studying

9. Add accounts and cross-device syncing. 

10. Make it so you can follow your friends and compare your progress to them.
